This naturally led me to become absolutely obsessed\n                    with Lego and I fell in love with building things. In\n                    elementary school, I joined the Lego Robotics team at my\n                    local middle school, which was my first real exposure to\n                    programming. In 2008, my family and I moved across the\n                    country from California to New York, where I attended middle\n                    school, high school, and college.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <div className=\"captioned-image\">\n                    <img src={me} style={styles.image} alt=\"\" />\n                    <p>\n                        <sub>\n                            <b>Figure 1:</b> A real photo of me developing this\n                            website :)\n                        </sub>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <p>\n                    I started programming more seriously in high school,\n                    initially learning how to scrape and interact with websites.\n                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects, many of them with\n                    one of my closest friends,{' '}\n                    <a\n                        rel=\"noreferrer\"\n                        target=\"_blank\"\n                        href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-bass-189a7919b/\"\n                    >\n                        Scott Bass\n                    </a>\n                    .
